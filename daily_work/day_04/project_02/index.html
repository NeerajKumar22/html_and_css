                                    too numerous to mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at

                                    How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from

                                    The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from (before) the mouse's hole.
                                    A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion, 
                                    and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had,
